  <h2 align="center">Introduction :</h2>
  <p>
    Hello everyone ! <br>
    I'm so happy to show you my new project. In a continuation of my AI learning path, I decided to create a project to find the word frequetly repeated in a large latin text. Funny isn't it ? To resolve this, I use and learn a new algorithm : The simulated annealing algorithm. What's that you'll tell me ? The explanation of this algorithm, and that I understood, will be in the next part. Moreover, During my fantastic process, I Thought that will be more interessting if I vizualise my data with a graph. So, for this reason, I use a python librairy : Matplotlib. But All in good time like I said in french "Tout viens Ã  point Ã  qui sait attendre" and in english "All things come to those who wait" (Thanks to my dictionnary wordreference.com ðŸ˜„). Anyway, I devided my explanation into a multiple parts. First, I introduce to the incredible universe of the simulated annealing algorithm. In a second time, I explain my process step by step with screenshots. Finnally, I'll tell you how can you install in local my project if you want to try my code on your machine. Before starting my explanatiion, I want to prevent you I'm not a senior or a junior so my co has a lot of nonsens coding practice but anyone don't make errors at the beginning. Now let's go !

  <h2 align="center">What is the simulated annealing algorithm ?</h2>
  <p>
    Good question ! The simulated annealing algorithm is an algorithm inspired by the smelting work. It's a probalistic optimization algorithm which can escape the local minimum or optimum to find the global maximum or minimum. It can be use as a research algorithm and it is more effective than the high climbing algorithm (my previous project).<br>
    This algorithm take a several parameter : first I need a set. In second position, I have the cooling rate and next the starting temperature, usually we choose 100. Finally we have the iteration, it begins at 0.<br>
    For each iteration, we select a random point in the set and compare it with the previous point. If the new point is higher than the previous point then the new point become the new reference point, in case of the global maximum search. But if the new point is smaller than the previous one, so I need to calculate the acceptance : 
  </p>
  <h5 align="center">acceptance (for a global maximum)= exponantial((new_value - previous_value) / current_temperature)</h5>
  <h5 align="center">acceptance (for a global minimum) = exponential((previous_value - current_value) / current_temperature)</h5>
  <p>
    Next, I chose a random value between 0 and 1. Then I compare this value with the acceptance. If the random value is smaller than the acceptance, so the worst solutions is accepted. Before the end, I calculate the new temperature :
  </p>
  <h5 align="center">temperature = current_temperature * cooling_rate</h5>
  <p>Finally, the function loop until the temperature is equal to 0 or the number of iteration reach 2000, this two condition are my objective. This is the simulated annealing algorithm.</p>

      <h4>Find a latin text :</h4>
      <p>
        The first thing to do before starting to code is to find a text in latin. For that, I use chatgpt to help me to translate the text that I chose. I starting to create, with the chatgp help, an eulogy about volcano. After a lot of          repetition to write the perfect text with 50 000 words, with no conclusive results, I decided to change the direction. I looked for a text about the punic wars, opposing Roma against Carthago during the ancient time. I found a            website describing the three wars. Then, I translate it in latin with chatGPT. 
      </p>
      <h6>This is an extract of the text :</h6>
      <blockquote>
        Primum Bellum Punicum (264-241 a.C.n.) fuit conflictus inter Carthaginem et Romam, praesertim de dominio Siciliae. Bellum hoc in Sicilia, mari et Africa septentrionali gestum est. Utrumque exercitum et victorias et clades paene           catastrophicas pertulit. Tandem Romani, quorum opes inexhaustae videbantur, ad necessitates belli navalis aptari potuerunt, atque vicerunt.
        Post bellum, quod usque tunc longissimum conflictum continuatum in historia fuisse creditur, Sicilia prima provincia Romana extra fines eius facta est. Tamen Carthago nondum finem habuit cum Roma: sic, postquam res suas internas          composuit et novas facultates pecuniarias obtinuit, bellum mox generatio postea renovatum est in forma Secundi Belli Punici.
        Causae Conflictus Relationes inter duas potestates plerumque pacatae fuerunt per saecula quae bellum praecesserunt. Foedera pacis, sphaeras cuiusque imperii influentiae determinantia, facta sunt annis 509, 348, 306, et 279 a.C.n.         Cum tamen Roma in Magna Graecia maiorem ambitionem ostendere coepit, Carthago decrevit suos in regione interesse tueri. Controversia maxime ardens inter duas potestates erat de Sicilia, insula magni momenti strategici et florenti         oeconomia, quam Carthaginienses diu civitatibus Graecis oppugnabant et quae nunc Romam allicitabat.
        Itaque, cum Roma Rhegium occupavit et Messana (Messine) a Roma petivit ut se tueretur contra duplicem minas Carthaginis et Hieronis II (tyranni Syracusarum), relationes inter duas magnas potestates Mediterraneae deterius factae           sunt. Utraque ex iis de hegemonia sollicita et aemula erat, nec facilis permittere alteram aliquam formam dominationis statuere.
        Anno 288 a.C.n., Mamertini, grex mercennariorum malae famae e Campania in Italia oriundus, Messanam ceperunt

      <h4>First function, clean the data :</h4>
      <p>
        I started my project by organizing my data that I can use. My function take one parameter, the text. Then, I remove all special character like comma or dot. After that, I split the text. The split method, in python, store items in a list. Moreover, I add each elements of my new list in an empty dictionnary without words equal or inferior of 3 letters, with a loop if the current word don't exist in the dictionnary. For each words, I count the frequency of appearence and add as the value of the current key. Finally, I return the dictionnary.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>Calculate probability</h4>
      <p>
        At this step, I create a new function that calculate for each keys the probability of the word. So, I create a new dictionnary, loop into my previous dictionnary and calculate the new value. In fact, At the moment where I write this line, I think to delete this function and calculate the value in the prÃ©vious function. Perharps for the next time.

      <h4>Simulated annealing algorithm function</h4>
      <p>
        Now, it's time to code the famous simulated annealing algorithm, the core of my project. This step, for me, was not easy. I started by a recursive function. It's work but I encountered two problems : if there are more of 1000 recursion then I have an error and I cannot return the final value when I print my function, on my terminal I see "None", so I can't use the value out of my function. To resolve my problems with the reccursive function, I did some research on the web and found a solution using the while loop. Then, I recreate entirely my function to implement a  while loop. Hurra ! it's work ! <br>
        The goal of my simulated annealing function is to return the word that appears the most time in the text. If you want more precision about this algorithm you can see my little explanation in the previous part, or see my commentary in my code file.

      <h4>Creation of the dataframe of my Dictionnary</h4>
      <p>
        When I finish my first goal for this project, I Thought that will be more interested if I have a data that I can visualize and I can learn about datavisualisation with matplotlib. My first problem is what is the story that I want to tell with my data ? Answer this question, help me to define boundary, select the right data and chart. It's not an easy task but I rise the challenge !<br>
        I started to think to display my data with scatter plot, then with a donut, and also with a scatterd point with different size. I didn't thought, at this moment, what data I want to show, I had not selected any values yet. With some discussion with my school mate, I started to define some boundaries, and selected some data. I search some tip, larn on the web and finally I chose to select 20 data representing the 20 words frequently appear in the text and visualize it with horizontal bar. But before built the chart, I need to transform my dictionnary into a dataframe.<br>
        To do that I chose pandas a python librairy for data manipulation. So, I created a function that return a dataframe of the 20 words with the most occurences.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>Building my horizontal bar chart</h4>
      <p>
        At this step, I write a new function that display My graph adding tittle and description for abssissa and ordinate.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>The final result</h4>
      <p>On my terminal :</p>
