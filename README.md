  <h2 align="center">Introduction :</h2>
  <p>
    Hello everyone ! <br>
    I'm so happy to show you my new project. In a continuation of my AI learning path, I decided to create a project to find the word frequently repeated in a large latin text. Funny isn't it ? To resolve this, I use and learn a new     
    algorithm : The simulated annealing algorithm. What is it you'll tell me ? I'll explain it, that I understood, in the next part. Moreover, During my fantastic process, I Thought that will be more 
    interessting if I vizualise my data with a graph. So, for this reason, I use two python librairies : Matplotlib and pandas. But All in good time like I said in french "Tout viens Ã  point Ã  qui sait attendre" and in english "All 
    things come to those who wait" (Thanks to my dictionnary wordreference.com ðŸ˜„). Anyway, I devided my explanation into a multiple parts. First, I introduce to the incredible universe of the simulated annealing algorithm. In a second 
    time, I explain my process step by step with screenshots. Finnally, I'll tell you how you can install in local my project if you want to try my code on your machine. Now let's go !

  <h2 align="center">What is the simulated annealing algorithm ?</h2>
  <p>
    Good question ! It's an algorithm inspired by the smelting work. It's a probalistic optimization algorithm which can escape the local minimum or optimum to find the global maximum or minimum. It can 
    be use as a research algorithm and it is more effective than the high climbing algorithm (my previous project).<br>
    This algorithm take a several parameter : a set, the cooling rate (use to reduce the temperature), temperature (usually I fix it with 100 as value) and finally the iteration (which begins at 0).<br>
    At the beginning, I choose a point randomly in my set as my starting point.<br> 
    For each iteration, I select another random point in the set and compare it with the previous point, or with the starting point if it's the first iteration. If the new point is higher than the previous one then he's 
    become the new reference point, in case of the global maximum search. But if the new point is smaller than the previous, so I calculate the acceptance : 
  </p>
  <h5 align="center">acceptance (for a global maximum)= exponantial((new_value - previous_value) / current_temperature)</h5>
  <h5 align="center">acceptance (for a global minimum) = exponential((previous_value - current_value) / current_temperature)</h5>
  <p>
    Next, I choose a random value between 0 and 1 and I compare this the acceptance. If the random value is smaller than the acceptance, so the worst solutions is accepted. <br>
    Before the end, I calculate the new temperature :
  </p>
  <h5 align="center">temperature = current_temperature * cooling_rate</h5>
  <p>Finally, the function loop until the temperature is equal to 0 or the number of iteration reach a limit number, this two conditions are my objectives. This is the simulated annealing algorithm.</p>

      <h4>Find a latin text :</h4>
      <p>
        The first thing I did before coding my project, it's to found the most important elements : a latin text. I used chatgpt to help me to translate the text that I chose. I started to create, with this tool, an eulogy 
        about volcano. After a lot of repetition to write the perfect text with 50 000 words, with no conclusive results, I decided to change the direction. I looked for a text about the punic wars, opposing Roma against Carthago during 
        the ancient time. Yes, I know This new subject is so different in comparison of my previous topic. I did some research to find a text, in that case three texts, describing the three wars. It's don't take a lot of time and when I 
        found it, I translated it in latin with chatGPT. 
      </p>
      <h6>This is an extract of the text :</h6>
      <blockquote>
        Primum Bellum Punicum (264-241 a.C.n.) fuit conflictus inter Carthaginem et Romam, praesertim de dominio Siciliae. Bellum hoc in Sicilia, mari et Africa septentrionali gestum est. Utrumque exercitum et victorias et clades paene          catastrophicas pertulit. Tandem Romani, quorum opes inexhaustae videbantur, ad necessitates belli navalis aptari potuerunt, atque vicerunt.
        Post bellum, quod usque tunc longissimum conflictum continuatum in historia fuisse creditur, Sicilia prima provincia Romana extra fines eius facta est. Tamen Carthago nondum finem habuit cum Roma: sic, postquam res suas internas         composuit et novas facultates pecuniarias obtinuit, bellum mox generatio postea renovatum est in forma Secundi Belli Punici.
        Causae Conflictus Relationes inter duas potestates plerumque pacatae fuerunt per saecula quae bellum praecesserunt. Foedera pacis, sphaeras cuiusque imperii influentiae determinantia, facta sunt annis 509, 348, 306, et 279 
        a.C.n. Cum tamen Roma in Magna Graecia maiorem ambitionem ostendere coepit, Carthago decrevit suos in regione interesse tueri. Controversia maxime ardens inter duas potestates erat de Sicilia, insula magni momenti strategici et 
        florenti oeconomia, quam Carthaginienses diu civitatibus Graecis oppugnabant et quae nunc Romam allicitabat.
        Itaque, cum Roma Rhegium occupavit et Messana (Messine) a Roma petivit ut se tueretur contra duplicem minas Carthaginis et Hieronis II (tyranni Syracusarum), relationes inter duas magnas potestates Mediterraneae deterius factae           sunt. Utraque ex iis de hegemonia sollicita et aemula erat, nec facilis permittere alteram aliquam formam dominationis statuere.
        Anno 288 a.C.n., Mamertini, grex mercennariorum malae famae e Campania in Italia oriundus, Messanam ceperunt

      <h4>First function, clean the data :</h4>
      <p>
        I started my project by organizing my data that I can use. My function take one parameter, the text. Then, I removed all special character like comma or dot. After that, I splited the text. The split method, in python, store 
        items in a list. Moreover, I added each elements of my new list in an empty dictionnary without words equal or smaller of 3 letters, if the word don't exist in the dictionnary. For each words, I counted the 
        frequency of appearence and added as the value of the current key. Finally, I returned the dictionnary.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>Calculate probability</h4>
      <p>
        At this step, I created a new function that calculate for each keys the probability of the word. I created a new dictionnary to store words with his value. In fact, At this moment where I 
        wrote this line, I thought to me perhaps it's better to calculate the probability value in my previous function. I'll do this later.
      </p>

      <h4>Simulated annealing algorithm function</h4>
      <p>
        Now, it's time to code the famous simulated annealing algorithm, the core of my project. This step, for me, was not easy. I started by a recursive function. It's work but I encountered two problems : if there are more 1000 
        recursion then I have an error on my terminal and I cannot store the final value and he's return "None". To resolve my problems with the reccursive function, I did 
        some research on the web and found a solution using the while loop. Then, I recreate entirely my function to implement a  while loop. Hurra ! it's work ! <br>
        The goal of my simulated annealing function is to return the word that appears the most time in the text. If you want more precision about this algorithm you can see my little explanation in the previous part, or see my 
        commentary in my code file.

      <h4>Creation of the dataframe of my Dictionnary</h4>
      <p>
        When I check my goal, I Thought it will a good opportunity to learn the data visualisation with Matplotlib. I taken a long time to answer one question that I've had in my mind : what is the story of my data ? Answer this   
        question, help me to define boundary, select the right data and chart. It's not an easy task but I rise the challenge !<br>
        I started to think to display my data with scatter plot, then with a donut, and also with a scattered point with different size. I didn't thought, at this moment, what data I want to show, I had not selected any values yet. With 
        some discussion with my school mate and some reflection with me, I started to define  boundaries, and selected some data. I search some tip, learn on the web. Finally , I chose to select 20 words   frequently appears in the 
        text, 
        and visualize it with horizontal bar. But before built the chart, I need to transform my dictionnary into a dataframe.<br>
        To do that I chose pandas another python librairy for data manipulation. So, I created a function that return a dataframe of the 20 words with the most occurences.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>Building my horizontal bar chart</h4>
      <p>
        At this step, I write a new function that display My graph adding tittle and description for abssissa and ordinate.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>The final result</h4>
      <p>On my terminal :</p>

      <p>This my chart :</p>

  <h2 align="center">Conclusion :</h2>
  <p>
    At the end, what I conclude? I learn a lot and it's just the beginning but even if My code isn't perfect I think that I have passed a very good time on my project. However, There are some points to improve in my code : first I can simplify my code base and finally I need to change some parameters, test each changes a lot, calculate the total of success in comparison to the total to have the success rate. Then I compare between each paramters and select the one wich has the best rate.
