  <p>
    Hello everyone ! <br>
    I'm so happy to show you my new project. In a continuation of my AI learning path, I decided to create a project to find the word frequetly repeated in a large latin text. Funny isn't it ? To resolve this, I use and learn a new algorithm : The simulated annealing algorithm. What's that you'll tell me ? The explanation of this algorithm, and that I understood, will be in the next part. Moreover, During my fantastic process, I Thought that will be more interessting if I vizualise my data with a graph. So, for this reason, I use a python librairy : Matplotlib. But All in good time like I said in french "Tout viens Ã  point Ã  qui sait attendre" and in english "All things come to those who wait" (Thanks to my dictionnary wordreference.com ðŸ˜„). Anyway, I devided my explanation into a multiple parts. First, I introduce to the incredible universe of the simulated annealing algorithm. In a second time, I explain my process step by step with screenshots. Finnally, I'll tell you how can you install in local my project if you want to try my code on your machine. Before starting my explanatiion, I want to prevent you I'm not a senior or a junior so my co has a lot of nonsens coding practice but anyone don't make errors at the beginning. Now let's go !

  <h2 align="center">What is the simulated annealing algorithm ?</h2>
  <p>
    Good question ! The simulated annealing algorithm is an algorithm inspired by the smelting work. It's a probalistic optimization algorithm which can escape the local minimum or optimum. It can be use as a research algorithm and it is more effective than the high climbing algorithm (my previous project).

      <h4>Find a latin text :</h4>
      <p>
        The first thing to do before starting to code is to find a text in latin. For that, I use chatgpt to help me to translate the text that I chose. I starting to create, with the chatgp help, an eulogy about volcano. After a lot of repetition to write the perfect text with 50 000 words, with no conclusive results, I decided to   change the direction.
